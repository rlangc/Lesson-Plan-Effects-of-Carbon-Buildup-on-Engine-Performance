   - **Activity:**  
     Introduce the topic with a brief overview of carbon buildup and its significance in combustion engines.  
     - Show a short video or images of engines with carbon buildup.
   - **Discussion:**  
     Ask participants what they already know about carbon buildup and its potential effects on engine performance.

#### 2. **What is Carbon Buildup? (20 minutes)**  
   - **Lecture:**  
     - Explain what carbon buildup is and how it forms inside a combustion engine.
     - Discuss the key components involved in the process: fuel, air, and spark.
     - Show visuals of how combustion works and how carbon residue accumulates.
   - **Q&A:**  
     Open the floor for any questions regarding the carbon buildup process.

#### 3. **How Does Carbon Buildup Affect Engine Performance? (25 minutes)**  
   - **Lecture:**  
     - Discuss the impacts of carbon buildup on engine performance, including:
       - Restricted oil flow
       - Increased friction and wear
       - Reduced lubrication and cooling
     - Use visuals or diagrams to illustrate the tight tolerances of engine components and how even small amounts of buildup can lead to significant issues.
   - **Demonstration (Optional):**  
     If possible, show an engine with carbon buildup, explaining where it affects the engine components.

#### 4. **How to Detect Carbon Buildup (20 minutes)**  
   - **Lecture:**  
     - Explain the method of detecting carbon buildup using spark plug inspection and a tiny camera.
     - Discuss other diagnostic tools available for engine inspections.
   - **Activity:**  
     Have participants practice inspecting spark plugs or using a camera (if available) to inspect engines for carbon buildup.
   - **Discussion:**  
     Discuss the importance of early detection and the risks of neglecting carbon buildup.

#### 5. **Solutions for Carbon Buildup (30 minutes)**  
   - **Short-Term Solutions:**  
     - Fuel additives and engine cleaning products.
     - Discuss the pros and cons of using these products.
   - **Long-Term Solutions:**  
     - Engine design improvements, fuel additives, and better combustion technology.
     - Discuss ongoing innovations aimed at reducing carbon buildup.
   - **Demonstration:**  
     If available, demonstrate how fuel additives work by adding them to a test engine.
   - **Group Activity:**  
     Break participants into small groups and have each group come up with a list of recommendations for maintaining engines to minimize carbon buildup.

#### 6. **Conclusion and Review (15 minutes)**  
   - **Summary:**  
     Recap the key points of the lesson, including the importance of understanding carbon buildup and its effects on engine performance.
   - **Q&A:**  
     Open the floor for any final questions or clarifications.
   - **Assessment:**  
     Hand out a short quiz or survey to assess student understanding of the material.

### Assessment Methods:
- Short Quiz on Carbon Buildup: 10-15 multiple choice and short answer questions to test comprehension.
- Group Activity Presentation: Groups will present their recommendations for reducing carbon buildup and maintaining engine performance.
- Spark Plug Inspection: Practical demonstration of inspecting spark plugs for carbon buildup.

### Optional Extensions:
- **Homework Assignment:**  
   Have students write a brief report on their own vehicles, detailing whether they have experienced carbon buildup and what steps they have taken to prevent or address it.
- **Advanced Topic Discussion:**  
   Introduce advanced technologies in engine design aimed at reducing carbon emissions and the role of fuel types in carbon buildup.

### Key Takeaways:
- Carbon buildup is a natural result of using fossil-based fuels in combustion engines.
- It can significantly impact engine performance, fuel efficiency, and lifespan.
- Detecting and managing carbon buildup early can help avoid costly repairs and enhance engine performance.
- There are both short-term solutions (fuel additives) and long-term solutions (engine design improvements) to mitigate carbon buildup.
